      <description>With 13 studio albums and a career that spanned more than a decade, The Beatles are not only known for being the best-selling band in history but also for their stylistic range. Although the Fab Four started off as a straightforward - albeit wildly successful - rock and roll outfit, they later broadened their output to include pop ballads, psychedelia and Indian raga rock. Their self-titled LP, released in 1968 and popularly known as ‘The White Album’, represented the height of their eclecticism, as it spanned hard rock (‘Back in the USSR’), ska (‘Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da’), country (‘Rocky Racoon’) and experimental (‘Revolution 9’).</description>

      <description>My name is Joshua Feldman and I am a Data Scientist at the BBC.
My background is unconventional. My first degree was in English literature and I began my career working as a copywriter and freelance journalist. However, I also harboured a strong interest in statistics and social science, so decided to retrain with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in quantitative research methodology from the London School of Economics.
I have written for a variety of publications, including The Guardian and The Times, and published two projects on DataCamp.</description>
