      <description>Resident Advisor (or ‘RA’ for its loyal readership of DJs and crate diggers) is an online magazine dedicated to electronic music. Since its launch in 2001, RA has reviewed thousands of LPs/EPs, which have ranged in style from house and techno to dubstep and drum and bass.
After many years spent reading RA reviews, I started to suspect that the magazine has a bias towards ambient music - respective albums seemed to be receiving consistently good ratings and a disproportionate number of ‘RA Recommends’ awards.</description>
