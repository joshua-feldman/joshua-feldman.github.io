      <description>Resident Advisor (or &#39;RA&#39; for its loyal readership of DJs and crate diggers) is an online magazine dedicated to electronic music. Since its launch in 2001, RA has reviewed thousands of LPs/EPs, which have ranged in style from house and techno to dubstep and drum and bass.
After many years spent reading RA reviews, I started to suspect that the magazine has a bias towards ambient music - respective albums seemed to be receiving consistently good ratings and a disproportionate number of &#39;RA Recommends&#39; awards.</description>

Although the Fab Four started off as a straightforward - albeit wildly successful - rock and roll outfit, they later broadened their output to include pop ballads, psychedelia and Indian raga rock.</description>
