      <description>My name is Joshua Feldman and I am a Data Scientist at Facebook.
My background is unconventional. My first degree was in English literature and I began my career working as a copywriter and freelance journalist. However, I also had a strong interest in statistics and social science, so decided to retrain with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in quantitative research methodology from the London School of Economics.
I have written for a variety of publications, including The Guardian and The Times, and published two projects on DataCamp.</description>
