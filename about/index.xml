      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Joshua Feldman and I am a Data Scientist at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My background is unconventional. My first degree was in English literature and I began my career working as a copywriter and freelance journalist. However, I also had a strong interest in statistics and social science, so decided to retrain with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in quantitative research methodology from the London School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have written for a variety of publications, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-feldman&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and The Times, and published two projects on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/joshuafeldman&#34;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
