This website is a personal blog and portfolio run by Joshua Feldman. It is static and does not require you to create an account.

### What personal data is collected
- Email: If you contact me directly (for example via `joshuafeldman@hotmail.com`), I will receive the information you choose to include in your message so I can reply.
- Server logs: The hosting platform records standard logs (e.g., IP address, browser, request URL) for security and reliability. These logs are kept only as long as needed for those purposes.
- Interactive tools: Inputs you provide to the Age–Date Converter are processed in your browser only and are not stored or sent to a server.

### Cookies and analytics
- I do not run advertising or behaviour-based tracking, and no cookies are set for analytics.
- If privacy-preserving analytics (such as Fathom) are enabled in the future to understand aggregate usage, this policy will be updated to reflect that.

### Third-party services
- Hosting: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Please review GitHub’s privacy notices for details of how they process connection data.
- Assets: Some pages load assets from third parties (e.g., Google Fonts CDN, Cloudflare CDNs, and social sharing scripts). These services may receive your IP address and user-agent when those assets are requested. Sharing buttons only contact their respective platforms if you click them.

### How your information is used and retained
- Information you send by email is used to respond to your inquiry and kept only as long as needed for that purpose.
- Connection logs retained by the hosting platform may be kept for a limited period to monitor abuse and protect the service.
- I do not sell or share personal data with advertisers.

### Your choices
- You can request that I delete prior correspondence you have sent me.
- You can use browser settings or extensions to block third-party resources if you prefer.

### Contact
If you have questions about this policy or your data, please email `joshuafeldman@hotmail.com`.
