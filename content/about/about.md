My name is Joshua Feldman and I am a Data Scientist at Facebook.

My background is unconventional. My first degree was in English literature and I began my career working as a copywriter and freelance journalist. However, I also had a strong interest in statistics and social science, so decided to retrain with a master's degree in quantitative research methodology from the London School of Economics.

I have written for a variety of publications, including [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-feldman) and The Times, and published two projects on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/joshuafeldman).
