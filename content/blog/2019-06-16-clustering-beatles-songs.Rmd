With 13 studio albums and a career that spanned more than a decade, The Beatles are not only known for being the best-selling band in history but also for their stylistic range. Although the Fab Four started off as a straightforward - albeit wildly successful - rock and roll outfit, they later broadened their output to include pop ballads, psychedelia and Indian raga rock. Their self-titled LP, released in 1968 and popularly known as 'The White Album', represented the height of their eclecticism, as it spanned hard rock ('Back in the USSR'), ska ('Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da'), country ('Rocky Racoon') and experimental ('Revolution 9').

For newcomers to the band - and seasoned listeners alike - such diversity can be overwhelming. It might even appear that The Beatles' music is uncategorisable - a series of discrete ventures into different genres and subgenres. However, with the power of **k-means clustering**, we can segment Beatles tracks according to 10 acoustic features that are used by Spotify and academic researchers to classify music, namely:

* __Acousticness__: Probability that a track was produced using acoustic instruments
* __Danceability__: Based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, etc
* __Duration__: Length of a track
* __Energy__: A measure of frenetic activity
* __Instrumentalness__: Probability that a track was performed using only instrumental sounds
* __Liveness__: Probability that a track was performed in front a live audience
* __Loudness__: Self-explanatory; measured in decibels
* __Speechiness__: The amount of spoken words in a track
* __Tempo__: How fast/slow a track is
* __Valence__: How happy/sad a track is is

## Data retrieval and preparation

The first thing we need to do is to retrieve the data. To do this, you need the `spotifyr` package and a client ID/secret for the Spotify API. To obtain access, follow the instructions on the [Spotify for Developers website](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/).

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(spotifyr)
library(tidyverse)

Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = read.csv("~/spotify/spotify_credentials.csv")[1,1])
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = read.csv("~/spotify/spotify_credentials.csv")[1,2])

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

Once we're hooked into the API, we can use the `get_artist_audio_features()` function to retrieve the Beatles' discography. Peeking inside the returned data frame, we can see columns on our audio features of interest - energy, tempo, duration, etc - as well as basic categorical features like album name, album release date and track name.

```{r warning = FALSE}
beatles <- get_artist_audio_features("The Beatles")
head(beatles)
```

The Beatles discography on Spotify includes a lot of live albums and compilation albums that would muddy our analysis. To filter them out, we simply filter for an `album_release_date` prior to 1971. We can then select our columns of interest and save them in a separate data frame.

```{r}
beatles_core <- beatles %>% 
  filter(album_release_date < "1971-01-01")

beatles_core <- beatles_core[-(111:117),]

beatles_core_metrics <- beatles_core %>% 
  select(track_name, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness,
         acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo)
```

## Data analysis

### Elbow plot

To help us decide how many clusters to choose, we can use the **elbow plot** technique. Unfortunately, the elbow plot exhibits a smooth curve that does not make it easy to decide how many clusters would be appropriate. Nevertheless, **eight seems an appropriate number**, since it sits somewhere in the middle of the elbow region of the plot and just before a temporary spike.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

beatles_core_metrics[2:10] <- scale(beatles_core_metrics[2:10])

# Use map_dbl to run many models with varying value of k (centers)
tot_withinss <- map_dbl(1:30,  function(k){
  model <- kmeans(x = beatles_core_metrics[2:10], centers = k)
  model$tot.withinss
})

# Generate a data frame containing both k and tot_withinss
elbow_df <- data.frame(
  k = 1:30,
  tot_withinss = tot_withinss
)

# Plot the elbow plot
ggplot(elbow_df, aes(x = k, y = tot_withinss)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:30) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8, linetype = "dashed")
```

### K means

Now that we have decided on how many clusters to use, we can fit our k-means model by using the `kmeans` function in the built-in `stats` package.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
beatles_k <- kmeans(beatles_core_metrics[2:10], centers = 8, nstart = 25)
```

We can now assign clusters to each of the tracks and visualise how they differ in key attributes. However, since it is impossible to visualise all of the 10 dimensions that we clustered them on, we can only compare two attributes at a time - for example energy and valence. Although limited, this starts to give an impression of how the clusters differ from one another: 3, 4 and 5 score relatively high on energy and valence, while 2 and 7 score low

```{r}
beatles_core_metrics$cluster <- beatles_k$cluster

beatles_core_metrics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(energy, valence, color = as.factor(cluster))) +
  geom_point()
```

We can get a more detailed impression of the clusters by looking at the **matrix of cluster centres**. The sign and magnitude of these values give us all the information we need to describe our clusters qualitatively.

```{r}
round(beatles_k$centers, 2)
```

## Summary of cluster characteristics

### Cluster #1: Melancholic meditations

Many of the tracks in this cluster were penned by George Harrison. They are sad and meditative, emphasising sensitivity and reflectiveness over attention-grabbing pace.

* __Key features__: Low valence
* __Number of songs__: 26 (14% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Something; Here Comes The Sun; Dear Prudence

### Cluster #2: Songs for the stage

With high liveness, Cluster #1 tracks give the impression that they were recorded in front of a live audience. They are loud, energetic and written with the stage in mind.

* __Key features__: High liveness
* __Number of songs__: 13 (7% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; Get Back; One After 909

### Cluster #3: Instrumentals

Cluster #3 comprises the instrumental portion of the Beatles' portfolio. Most of the Yellow Submarine album - the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name - is sorted into this cluster.

* __Key features__: High instrumentalness, low loudness, low valence, low energy, high acousticness
* __Number of songs__: 9 (5% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Flying; Sea of Monsters; Sea of Holes

### Cluster #6: Typical Beatles

Cluster #6 represents the closest thing The Beatles have to a uniform sound. It has no distinguishing features, with average loadings for all nine of the acoustic features. Fittingly, it is the most populous cluster, representing 30% of The Beatles' discography.

* __Key features__: None
* __Number of songs__: 54 (30% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Please Please Me; Eight Days A Week; Help!

### Cluster #7: Lively pop songs

Cluster #7 picks up early Beatles classics, which are characterised by their tempo and high energy.

* __Key features__: High energy, high tempo
* __Number of songs__: 29 (16% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Love Me Do; Twist and Shout; Can't Buy Me Love

### Cluster #8: Calm ballads

This cluster incorporates many of McCartney's most loved ballads and acoustic numbers. It is primarily characterised by a relatively low energy.

* __Key features__: Low energy, high acousticness, low loudness, low valence
* __Number of songs__: 12 (7% of total)
* __Typical examples__: Blackbird; Yesterday; The Long And Winding Road

## Concluding remarks

K-means clustering has done a decent job of organising The Beatles' overwhelmingly diverse discography into a set of coherent segments. The set of nine audio features clearly describe the tracks with some accuracy, allowing the algorithm to make sensible groupings. There remain some question marks - I am still scratching my head as to why early songs like 'Love Me Do' rank low on danceability - but overall the method has proved an effective means of studying one of the most eclectic rock portfolios in music history.
